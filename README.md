This is a frontend todo app which applies redux, redux-form, react-day-picker and uses Bulma css as well as Material ui. 
This app has already been converted to a full-stack app. I use MERN stack and include a jwt verification methods for authentication.
I create this website because my girlfriend wants a todo app in which she can save and displays todos via its date of creation.
